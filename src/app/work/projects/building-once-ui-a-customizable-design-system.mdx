## Overview

As a fresh graduate, I'm excited to be part of the team developing a flexible and customizable design system. This project is helping me learn about Next.js for front-end development and Figma for design collaboration.

## Key Learning Areas

- **Component Library**: Learning to build modular, reusable UI components using React in Next.js, with a focus on understanding accessibility and responsiveness principles.
- **Theming and Customization**: Exploring how to implement a theming system that allows for customization of color palettes, typography, and layout styles using CSS variables and Figma tokens.
- **Figma Integration**: Getting hands-on experience in collaborating with designers through a shared Figma library, and learning how to maintain consistency between design assets and code.
- **Documentation**: Beginning to understand the importance of comprehensive documentation, and learning to use Storybook to showcase components and usage patterns.

## Technologies I'm Learning

- **Next.js**: Understanding server-rendered React applications.
- **Figma**: Learning to work with design assets and prototypes.
- **Styled-Components**: Exploring component-based styling in React.
- **Storybook**: Getting introduced to building interactive component libraries.

## Challenges and Growth Opportunities

As a newcomer to professional software development, I'm facing challenges in understanding the balance between flexibility and consistency in design systems. I'm eager to learn more about design tokens and guidelines for component customization. The process of collaborating with designers using Figma and version control with Git is new to me, but I'm excited to improve my skills in these areas.

## Future Goals

I aim to contribute meaningfully to the design system as it grows. I'm looking forward to seeing how our work will impact future projects, potentially leading to faster development cycles and improved collaboration between design and development teams. This experience is providing a strong foundation for my career in front-end development and UI/UX design.
